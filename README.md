# Cryptocurrency Analysis

Cryptocurrencies are an increasing trend on the market. To review cryptocurrencies we would need to take a large data set of hundreds of current currencies and distill them down to the ones that are actively trading investments. We primarily used python and pandas library tools. 

After distilling the cryptos down we then created several visuals:
  - Elbow Curve Plot
  - 3D Scatter Plot
  - 2D Scatter Plot
  
Each of these visual representations are interactive.
